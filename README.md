# Programming 2 (2023): Interactive Fiction - Template

Build your game on top of the provided framework `Sources/prog2-2023-project/InteractiveFictionFramework`.
- Do not modify the files contained in that folder!
- You can find an example project using that framework in the lab solutions repo.

## Possible issue when building

Double-check the .vscode/launch.json file:
- Wherever you see the line `workspaceFolder:prog2-2023-project-template`, adjust it to your group's repo name.
- Normally VSC adjusts this automatically, but if it hasn't then perform this change yourself.
